# Railway Crossing Gate

Project within CES laboratory training at TU Ilmenau. The railway model in Zusebau room 2045 should be extended by a Crossing Gate. The gate will be operated by a servo motor, a train has to be detected by sensors before and after the crossing. The gate should be open when no train is in the area, the gate should be closed as soon as a train is on or near the crossing. Under no circumstances can the gate be open while a train is passing. Think about the right set of sensors to assure this requirement. During this task, modifications to the railway model are not allowed or needed. 

## Getting Started

If you do not actually have the model available and want to rebuild the physical system, please check our schematics and attune your components accordingly. The software itself can be downloaded (e.g via github desktop software).

### Prerequisites

In order to upload (download) the Arduino program code you most likely want to install the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

## Deployment

This project consists of several Arduino sketches that were part of the development process and typically consist of one specific component that, at the end would be used in the final work which is also sketch called *ConnectAllComponents*.
